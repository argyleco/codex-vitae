## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun.
- It's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe.
- This document is always incomplete and out of date.
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, whimsy, or chance. 
- I believe beliefs are best categorized into four types: beliefs about beliefs (metabeliefs), beliefs about perceptions (how reality seems to be), beliefs about the meaning of reality (opinions about how myself and others should approach life), and beliefs about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).

### Type 2: Perceptions
How reality seems to be. 2A is about how my mind and senses seem to work, 2B is about my take on spirituality, and 2C is about how I think the external world is based on the information I have.

#### 2A Perceptions: Senses
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

-

#### 2B Perceptions: Supersenses
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.



#### 2C Perceptions: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

- Everything in life is understood in relationship to everything else. I only know who I am in relation to other people.
- We all share a single consciousness, but through quantum mechanics every person gets to experience life as their own individual self.
- Defining the self always contains an element of mystery, the unseen - like how a knife can't cut itself, or a light can't illume itself.
- We evolved as away for the universe to know itself. We evoke light through our eyes and sound through our ears, without these faculities for awareness who would be able to appreciate the beauty of the universe.
- The rules of the universe are based in pure and beautiful math, fractals, prime numbers, etc.
- Life and matter is inifinte on macro and micro levels, we appear in the middle because we can never see an ultimate start or end.
- Life is a dream.

### Type 3: Opinions
Beliefs about how I interpret my perceptions and synthesize the meaning of reality. 3A is about what this means for my own approach to life, and 3B is about how I believe society should be structured.

#### 3A: Opinions: Shoulds
How I believe I should approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.

- I should regularly verify that I want to continue opting-in to everything in this document on the first of every month. 
- I should create a new monthly report on the first of every month.
- I should create a new yearly report every year on my birthday.
- I should strive to know what I really believe, and to make sure my beliefs work well together.
- I should not dilly-dally.
- I should be my word.
- I should have good intentions.
- I should admit to being the maker of my own meaning.
- I should not feel sorry for myself and avoid competitive suffering.
- I should have a vision that I'm striving for.
- I should rally others with my vision.
- I should be the change I want to see.
- I should stake my reputation on my better self.
- I should be comfortable with the consequences of being who I am.
- I should make my own advice and take it.
- I should manage my stress, health, and clarity by consistently eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep.
- I should study my mistakes.
- I should retry things I don’t like every once in a while.
- I should go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts.

How I believe society should be structured.

- Gay marriage should be legal everywhere.
- Abortion should be legal everywhere.
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
- Health care should be available and affordable to everyone who needs it.
- The death penalty should never be used.
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment.
- Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry.
- Average citizens should not have readily access to guns.
- Guaranteed basic income should be a thing available to everyone.
- Free college education should be available to everyone who wants it.

### Type 4: Predictions
How I think things will be in the future, based on the approximate year I think they’ll come true.

#### 4: Predictions: By 2016
- Wager with Rick Webb: by March 1st, descendants of Google Glass will be seen regularly in the wild (in the same way that Fitbits, NikeFuel bands, and retina MacBook Pros are in 2013). (I’m gonna lose this one, but hoping to go double or nothing for 2025. Rick?)

#### 4. Predictions: By 2025
- Global warming will severely impact the global economy in some way and threaten the livelihood of people in some parts of the world.
- The technology to program DNA (via CRISPR) will allow us to easily and cheaply edit, remove, and add DNA in embryos. We will start with obvious applications (like preventing Alzheimers) but not stop there.
- Self-driving vehicles will begin to replace truck drivers, impacting employment rates in the country.

#### 4: Predictions: By 2030
- We'll have a President that admits to being atheist or agnostic by 2025.
- Most jobs lost between 2008-2012 aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)

#### 4: Predictions: By 2050
- Computers will be building better computers than humans.
- Guaranteed basic income will be available in a majority of first world countries. Employment will be decoupled from having the means to live.

- Solar will overcome gas and oil in usage.

#### 4: Predictions: By 2100
- There will be 10 billion people on the planet at once.
- 80% of people will live in cities and new mega-cities.
